As root, do:
 - mkdir -p /var/lib/cgmanagerfs
 - ./cgmanagerfs /var/lib/cgmanagerfs/ -o allow_other -o allow_root

In your container config, add:
 - lxc.hook.mount = /path/to/the/branch/cgmanagerfs.hook

Then start your container and you should see a bunch of bind-mounts for
all the relevant paths of cgmanagerfs.
